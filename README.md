# Gesture-Controls
Requirements
  1. Java installed on your system (Just use any Java IDE, I use BlueJ, it is easier that way.)
  2. Arduino IDE.
  3. Arduino Uno Board
  4. Flex Sensor(s)
  5. Joystick Module compatible with Arduino UNO.




Procedure
  1.Open the "Mouse_Control.ino" file with the Arduino IDE and upload it to your board.
  2.Build your Circuit (see circuit_image).
  3.Run the java code in your Java IDE of choice(read NOTE at the end of document).
  4.Enjoy.




NOTE : 
Make sure you run your JAVA IDE in ADMINISTRATOR mode (right-click--> "run as administrator"). If your IDE isn't doesn't have admin privileges then the controller won't work outside the IDE window.
