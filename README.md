# Gesture-Controls
Requirements
  1. Java installed on your system (Just use any Java IDE, I use BlueJ, it is easier that way.)
  2. Arduino IDE.
  3. Arduino Uno Board
  4. Flex Sensor(s)
  5. Joystick Module compatible with Arduino UNO.


NOTE : 
Make sure you run your JAVA IDE in ADMINISTRATOR mode (right-click--> "run as administrator"). If your IDE isn't doesn't have admin privileges then the controller won't work outside the IDE window.
